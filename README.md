# ML.WikiDetox

A binary machine learning text classification sample using ML.Net

The C# sample code in this repository implements the code in the blog post
[Filter Toxic Comments With C# And ML.NET Machine Learning](https://medium.com/machinelearningadvantage/filter-toxic-wikipedia-comments-with-c-and-ml-net-machine-learning-ad94869f90b4)
by Mark Farragher. Be sure to red Mark's blog to better understand the machine learn parts of the
**wikiDetox** project.

The **DetoxConverter** project is just a small dataframe based project that converts the available Wiki data source
into the format that was used in Mark's blog post (since the data format described by Mark does not seem to be available any longer).
